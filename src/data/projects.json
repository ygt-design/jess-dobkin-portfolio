        "mainDescription": "As The Mad Chef (2000–2003), the artist challenges the conﬁnes of role and identity, breaking through internal boundaries in discovery of uncharted territories. Live and video installments have been presented at numerous venues. At the Jack Tilton Gallery in New York, audiences are invited to paint with coloured cake frosting, replicating historical masterpieces and sugar-coating arranged still lives. Cakes become canvases, to be critiqued and then eaten.",
